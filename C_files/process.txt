Loading in images in C/C++
- I want to still use openCV since we can read, display, convert,
 and it still stores the images as a 2-d array. 

- Since openCV stores already in a matrix I am just thinking that we can store the images in memory
 as a 2-d array, and to iterate throught them I might just use pointer arithmetic since it is faster?

Conversion
- I think I am just going to loop through the entire image and each pixel and convert manually
 for control. 


GPU version
- I want to make the program to work on multiple GPU's so I am leaning towards using openCL?
 Need to look at documentation to figure out how it will work.
